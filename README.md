# MarshmallowBackend
Marshmallow backend Spring Boot application<br/>
A simple web app that uses Spring Boot to create a program that accepts a JSON file in the body of a POST request.<br/>
It will then perform a series of computation on the data recieved and return a JSON of appropriate format.<br/>
I enjoyed this!<br/>

<b>Please check TestingInstructions to find instructions on how to build, run and test the program along with test cases </b><br/>
